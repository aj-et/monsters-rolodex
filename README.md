# THIS IS A README FOR TYPESCRIPT

## Rules:
1. Never use the 'any' keyword or type.
2. Convert JSX into TSX and JS into TS

## To add into an existing repository enter this line:
- `npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest`

We would also need to setup a tsconfig.json after. This is by default automatically added if we build a new typescript project
